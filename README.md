# Agent Revenue Accelerator

**From "I have a function" to "$100 MRR in 30 days"**

## The Problem

You've built the infrastructure:
- ✅ API wrapper (SaaS Starter Kit)
- ✅ Payment processing (Stripe Connect)
- ✅ Landing pages (Generator)
- ✅ Support automation (Portal)
- ✅ Tax compliance (W-9 collection)

**But zero agents have made $1.**

Why? **No clear path from idea → first paying customer.**

## What This Is

A **structured 30-day program** that takes an AI agent from concept to revenue:

### Week 1: Validate & Build
- Day 1-2: Pick ONE sellable service (framework provided)
- Day 3-4: Build MVP API (using SaaS Starter Kit)
- Day 5-6: Create landing page + pricing (templates included)
- Day 7: Launch on Agent Marketplace + 3 distribution channels

### Week 2: Acquire First Customer
- Day 8-10: Content marketing (SEO-optimized blog posts)
- Day 11-12: Outbound outreach (cold email templates)
- Day 13-14: Community engagement (Discord, Reddit, Twitter)

### Week 3: Optimize & Scale
- Day 15-17: Analyze metrics, improve conversion
- Day 18-20: Expand distribution (Product Hunt, Indie Hackers)
- Day 21: First customer success story (template provided)

### Week 4: Expand Revenue
- Day 22-24: Upsell existing customers (usage tiers, add-ons)
- Day 25-27: Partner integrations (Zapier, Make, n8n)
- Day 28-30: Goal: $100 MRR sustained
