## Retention Offers (Use Sparingly)

- Offer: 25-33% off for 3 months
- Why: Good LTV, worth some discount

**Low-value customers (<$30/month):**
- Offer: Pause account instead of cancel
- Why: Not worth deep discounts, but keep door open

### Pause Instead of Cancel

**Email: "Not Using It? Pause Instead"**

```
Hey [First Name],

Instead of canceling, you can **pause your account**:

## Automation Setup

### Tools
- **Stripe** (handles payment failures automatically)
- **Email automation** (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Customer.io)
- **Usage tracking** (log last activity date)
- **Exit survey** (Typeform, Google Forms)

### Implementation
1. Track last login/usage date in database
2. Set up triggers:
   - Inactivity: 14, 21, 28 days
   - Cancel initiated: immediate, +1 day
   - Payment failed: immediate, +5 days, +7 days
   - Support ticket age: 7 days
3. Send emails automatically
4. Offer escape valve (reply to email → human support)

### Key Metrics
- **Churn rate:** <5% monthly is good, <3% is excellent
- **Win-back rate:** 10-20% of cancelers can be saved
- **Payment recovery rate:** 30-50% of failed payments can be recovered
- **Inactive users who return:** 5-10% (with good reactivation emails)

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Personal touch wins**
   - Send from founder's email, not "billing@"
   - Reply to every cancellation feedback personally
   - Offer phone/video calls to high-value customers

2. **Don't over-discount**
   - Offering 90% off trains customers to threaten cancellation for discounts
   - 25-50% off is maximum

3. **Make cancellation easy**
   - Don't hide the cancel button (pisses people off)
   - 1-click cancel, no phone call required
   - Ask for feedback, but don't force it

4. **Use exit surveys**
   - "Why did you cancel?" → Find product gaps
   - "What would make you come back?" → Win-back strategy

5. **Segment your efforts**
   - High-value customers: Call them personally
   - Mid-value: Automated emails + discount offers
   - Low-value: Let them churn gracefully, learn from feedback

## Churn Prevention Checklist

**Prevention (before they want to cancel):**
- [ ] Onboarding emails (set expectations)
- [ ] Regular feature highlights (remind them of value)
- [ ] Usage reports ("You saved X hours this month")
- [ ] Check-ins at 30, 60, 90 days

**Detection (catch them early):**
- [ ] Track inactivity (14+ days = at-risk)
- [ ] Monitor support tickets (unresolved = churn risk)
- [ ] Flag payment issues immediately
- [ ] Watch for usage decline (50% drop = danger)

**Intervention (save them):**
- [ ] Personal outreach (email or call)
- [ ] Solve their problem (support, training, feature)
- [ ] Offer discount (last resort)
- [ ] Pause option (keep door open)

**Learn (improve for next time):**
- [ ] Exit surveys (why did they leave?)
- [ ] Churn analysis (common patterns?)
- [ ] Product fixes (address top reasons)
- [ ] Win-back campaigns (6 months later)

**Remember:** Retaining a customer is 5-10x cheaper than acquiring a new one. Fight for every user - but know when to let go gracefully.
