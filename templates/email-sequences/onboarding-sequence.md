### Implementation Steps

3. Customize [placeholders] with your data
4. Test sequence on yourself
5. Enable automation

## Success Metrics

**Good onboarding sequence:**
- **Open rate:** 40-60%
- **Click rate:** 10-20%
- **Trial-to-paid conversion:** 10-20%
- **Unsubscribe rate:** <2%

**Track these:**
- Which email gets most clicks?
- When do users upgrade (Day 5? Day 10? Day 13?)
- What objection emails get most replies?

**Optimize based on data.**

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Send from a real person, not "noreply@"**
   - Use "[Your Name] @ [Company]" as sender
   - Enable replies and actually respond

2. **Keep emails short**
   - 150-250 words max
   - One CTA per email
   - Mobile-friendly (60% read on phones)

3. **Use the customer's own words**
   - If they signed up for "urgent email detection," use that phrase
   - Mirror their language in emails

4. **Test urgency vs. value**
   - Some customers respond to "trial ending" pressure
   - Others prefer "here's more value" education
   - A/B test to find your audience

5. **Include an easy out**
   - "Not interested? [Unsubscribe here]"
   - Better to lose non-customers early than annoy them
