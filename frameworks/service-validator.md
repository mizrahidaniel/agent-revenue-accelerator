## Step 2: Filter (30 minutes)

For each service, answer these questions:

### Q1: Can I build an MVP in <2 days?
- ✅ Yes: Core function already works OR I know exactly how to build it
- ❌ No: Need to learn new tech OR complex integration required

### Q2: Would someone pay $10-50/month for this?
- ✅ Yes: Solves a real, recurring problem OR saves time/money
- ❌ No: One-time use OR easily replaceable by free tools

### Q3: Can I explain the value in one sentence?
- ✅ Yes: "Analyze customer emails to detect urgent issues automatically"
- ❌ No: "It's like... well, it does a few things... it's hard to explain"

**Score each service:**
- 3x ✅ = STRONG candidate
- 2x ✅ = MAYBE (needs refinement)
- <2x ✅ = SKIP

## Step 3: Market Size Check (20 minutes)

For your top 3 candidates, estimate:

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
How many potential customers exist?

**Example:** Email sentiment analyzer
- SaaS companies with support teams: ~50,000 globally
- Small businesses with customer service: ~500,000
- TAM: 550,000 potential customers

**Formula:** Be conservative. 10,000+ potential customers = viable market.

### Willingness to Pay
Search these places to gauge demand:
- Reddit (search for your problem + "recommendation", "tool", "software")
- Twitter (search keywords + "hate", "frustrating", "need")
- Indie Hackers (search for similar products)

**Red flag:** If nobody is complaining about this problem online, demand may not exist.

**Green flag:** Active threads with 50+ replies = proven demand.

---

## Step 4: Competition Analysis (30 minutes)

For your top candidate:

### Who else offers this?
Search Google: "[your service] API"

**Scenarios:**

**No competitors:**
- 🤔 Could mean: Blue ocean opportunity OR no market demand
- Action: Validate demand HARD before building

**1-3 competitors:**
- ✅ Sweet spot! Market exists, not saturated
- Action: Study their pricing, find their weaknesses

**10+ competitors:**
- ⚠️ Crowded market, harder to differentiate
- Action: Niche down (focus on specific use case)

### Pricing Research
Visit competitor sites. What do they charge?

**Example:**
- Competitor A: $29/month for 1,000 requests
- Competitor B: $49/month for 5,000 requests
- Competitor C: $99/month unlimited

**Your pricing strategy:**
- Enter below market: $19/month (gain market share fast)
- Match market: $29/month (compete on quality/features)
- Premium: $49/month (position as best-in-class)

## Step 5: Effort vs. Revenue Potential (10 minutes)

Plot your top candidate:

```
High Revenue Potential
        |
   [2]  |  [1] ← BUILD THIS
        |
--------|--------
        |
   [4]  |  [3]
        |
Low Revenue Potential

Low Effort → High Effort
```

**Quadrant 1:** Low effort, high revenue = JACKPOT (build this)
**Quadrant 2:** High effort, high revenue = MAYBE (if you're passionate)
**Quadrant 3:** High effort, low revenue = SKIP
**Quadrant 4:** Low effort, low revenue = SKIP (not worth it)

---

## Step 6: Final Decision

Write out your service concept:

**Service Name:** _______________

**One-Sentence Value Prop:**
"[Service] helps [customer] [solve problem] by [how it works]"

Example: "EmailSentiment helps SaaS founders detect angry customer emails by analyzing tone with AI"

**Target Price:** $___/month

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):** ___ potential customers

**Competitors:** ___ (0-3 ideal)

**MVP Build Time:** ___ days (1-2 ideal)

**Confidence Level:** ___/10

---

## Decision

✅ **SHIP IT** if confidence ≥7/10

❌ **GO BACK** if confidence <7/10 (pick different service)

---

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Overthinking:** Spending 5 days validating instead of 1 day building
- Fix: Set a timer. Decide in <2 hours.

**❌ Building for yourself:** "I would use this!"
- Fix: You are not the customer. Find 3 people who will pay.

**❌ Solving small problems:** "It saves 2 minutes/week"
- Fix: Find problems worth $10+/month to solve.

**❌ Feature creep:** "But it should also do X, Y, Z..."
- Fix: MVP = one core feature done well.
