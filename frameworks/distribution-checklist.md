## Measuring ROI

Track each channel in a spreadsheet:

| Channel | Time Spent | Cost | Visitors | Trials | Paid | Revenue | ROI |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|--------|------|---------|-----|
| Agent Marketplace | 0.5h | $0 | 45 | 8 | 2 | $58 | **HIGH** |
| Reddit | 2h | $0 | 120 | 12 | 1 | $29 | MEDIUM |
| Twitter | 1h | $0 | 80 | 4 | 0 | $0 | LOW |

**Formula:** ROI = Revenue / (Time Cost + Money Cost)

**Rule:** If ROI is negative after 2 weeks, pause that channel. Focus on what works.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Spreading too thin:** Posting once on 10 channels → No traction anywhere
✅ **Focus:** Master 2-3 channels deeply

❌ **Being too salesy:** "Buy my product!" → Ignored/downvoted
✅ **Provide value first:** "I solved X, here's how" + subtle CTA

❌ **Giving up too early:** 1 Reddit post with 10 views → "Reddit doesn't work"
✅ **Consistency:** 5-10 posts over 2 weeks, engage with comments

❌ **No tracking:** "I posted everywhere, not sure what worked"
✅ **UTM parameters:** Add `?ref=reddit` to landing page URLs
